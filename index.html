            <p>On 23 August 2023, the Indian Space Research Organisation reached a significant milestone by successfully landing Chandrayaan-3's lander and rover on the Moon.[3] With this, India became the fourth country to land on the Moon and first to land near the southern polar region of the Moon. The soft-landing was followed by successful deployment of Pragyan Rover. Recognizing this achievement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proclaimed August 23 as "National Space Day" in India.</p>
